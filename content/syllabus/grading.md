### Homeworks (60%)
There will be **three homework assignments** (20% each), aligned with the major course blocks:  

1. **HW1 (Weeks 3–5):** Programming foundations in R and Python.  
2. **HW2 (Weeks 5–7):** SQL queries, web scraping, and API integration.  
3. **HW3 (Weeks 7–9):** Software engineering for data science (functions, packages, testing, documentation).  

Each homework is:  
- **Released during a lecture** (Weeks 3, 5, 7).  
- **Discussed the following week** in the practical (Weeks 4, 6, 8).  
- **Due the week after** (Weeks 5, 7, 9).  

Assignments are individual and must be submitted via GitHub Classroom.

### Group Project (40%)
The semester project is the **capstone assignment**. Working in groups, you will design a **complete data pipeline**: from data collection and management (via SQL, APIs, web scraping) to analysis (R/Python), and finally to communication (dashboard, web app, or BI report).  

Deliverables must be hosted on **GitHub** and be **fully reproducible**.  
Evaluation criteria include:  

- **Data pipeline & reproducibility** (SQL integration, scripts, documentation)  
- **Code quality** (clarity, modularity, version control, testing, literate programming)  
- **Application/visualization** (Shiny/Streamlit app, Power BI dashboard, or similar)  
- **Final presentation** (clarity, storytelling, reflection on tools and methods)  

Project timeline in the schedule:  
- **Week 11:** Project supervision & integration check  
- **Week 12:** Mid-term project review (practical session)  
- **Week 13:** Refinement & preparation of deliverables  
- **Week 14:** Final presentations & peer review

### Participation & Engagement (Bonus)
Participation is **not mandatory** but can earn you a **bonus on the final grade**.  
Students may volunteer to **present exercise corrections** during practical sessions.  

- Bonus points are awarded for **clarity, correctness, and effort**.  
- Multiple contributions are possible, but the bonus is capped.  
- The bonus can make a difference in **borderline cases** (e.g., raising a 3.5 to a 4.0).

## Summary
Your grade will be determined by:  
- **60%** three homeworks (Weeks 3–9)  
- **40%** semester-long group project (Weeks 11–14)  
- **Bonus** for active engagement through exercise corrections  

This structure rewards both **individual mastery** (homeworks) and **teamwork on applied projects**, while encouraging active participation.

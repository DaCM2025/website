This course introduces students to the **essential tools and practices of modern data and code management**, with a focus on **business analytics applications**.  
It covers a broad spectrum of programming languages and platforms — including **R, Python, SQL, GitHub, Power BI, and modern AI assistants (LLMs)** — to help students design reproducible, collaborative, and impactful data workflows.  

### Topics covered include:
- **Reproducible research:** Literate programming with [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).  
- **Version control & collaboration:** Best practices with [GitHub](https://github.com/).  
- **Programming foundations:** Data structures, logical operators, control structures, and functions in **R and Python**.  
- **Databases & SQL:** Querying, joining, and aggregating data, with integration into R and Python.  
- **Visualization & reporting:** From exploratory analysis with [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) and Python’s visualization libraries to **interactive dashboards in Power BI**.  
- **Software engineering for data science:** Functions, testing, documentation, and package creation in R/Python.  
- **Web & data collection:** Web scraping and APIs (using Rvest, BeautifulSoup, requests, etc.).  
- **Interactive applications:** Development of web apps with [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).  
- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Leveraging AI assistants responsibly for code generation, documentation, and analytics.  
- **Communication & dissemination:** Building reproducible websites, dashboards, and reports for sharing results.  

### Learning outcomes
By the end of the course, students will be able to:  
- Build and manage **reproducible data pipelines** across R, Python, and SQL.  
- Develop and share **interactive applications and dashboards**.  
- Apply **best practices in coding, documentation, testing, and collaboration**.  
- Critically integrate **AI-powered tools** into their analytical workflow.  
- Deliver **professional, reproducible, and transparent projects** from data collection to final presentation.  

No prior background in IT or programming is assumed, but students should bring curiosity and motivation to acquire **hands-on programming skills** that will serve them in their academic and professional careers.

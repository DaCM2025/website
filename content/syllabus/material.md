### Laptops
Please bring a laptop to class if possible. We encourage **collaborative work**, and ideally we aim for at least one laptop for every two students. Both **homework assignments** and the **group project** involve coding and teamwork, so having access to a laptop will make your learning experience smoother.  

If you are considering purchasing a laptop, students from Swiss universities can benefit from preferential pricing through the [Neptun Projekt](https://www.projektneptun.ch/) or [EPFL's Poseidon](https://poseidon.epfl.ch/).

You do not need to buy a new laptop if you do not have one â€” sharing with classmates is fine.

### Operating Systems
The course can be followed on **MacOS, Windows, or Linux**. All three operating systems are supported, and we provide installation guides for each. Linux remains a strong option for data science, but any modern laptop will work.

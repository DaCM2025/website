Welcome to the website of *Data and Code Management: From Collection to Application*, a course offered in the **Master in Business Analytics** at HEC Lausanne during the autumn semester 2025.

This course equips students with the **foundational tools and best practices of modern data science**, focusing on how to collect, manage, analyze, and share data in a **reproducible and collaborative way**.

Throughout the semester, students will explore:

* **Programming in R and Python** for data wrangling, visualization, and modeling.
* **SQL and database management**, essential for business analytics and large-scale data handling.
* **Version control with GitHub**, enabling collaboration and transparent workflows.
* **Reproducible research** using Quarto and Jupyter Notebook.
* **Software engineering practices** in data science (functions, testing, packages, documentation).
* **Modern tools for communication and application**, including Power BI dashboards, Shiny apps, and Python web apps.
* **Large Language Models (LLMs)** as assistants for coding, documentation, and analytics — used critically and responsibly.

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

* Build and document **reproducible data pipelines** across R, Python, and SQL.
* Create and share **interactive applications** (Shiny, Streamlit, Power BI).
* Manage projects and collaborate effectively using GitHub.
* Package their work as professional deliverables — from code libraries to dashboards.
* Critically integrate **AI-powered tools** into their analytical workflows.

This course emphasizes **hands-on learning and project-based application**. Students will work in teams to develop a complete analytics project — from raw data collection to a polished, interactive presentation.
